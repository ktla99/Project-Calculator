# Project-Calculator

Project calculator was made in order to exhibit my ongoing skill of being able to analyze and expand my knowledge of using JavaScript to create a working calculator. 

The calculator has all the basic functions of a calculator and the ability to remove previous entries with AC (all clear button).
